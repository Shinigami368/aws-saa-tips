## 4. MOST CRITICAL TRICK PATTERNS

### 1. "Least Operational Overhead" = CHOOSE SERVERLESS
- Athena > EMR
- Fargate > EC2
- Secrets Manager > custom Lambda rotation
- Aurora Serverless > manual scaling

### 2. Config vs CloudTrail
- **Config** = resource configuration STATE (what changed?)
- **CloudTrail** = API call RECORD (who did what?)

### 3. Gateway VPC Endpoint is FREE
- Gateway endpoint for S3 and DynamoDB = free
- Interface endpoint for other services = costs money

### 4. Object Lock Modes
- **Compliance** = NOBODY can delete (including root)
- **Governance** = specially permissioned users can override

### 5. Multi-AZ vs Read Replica
- **Multi-AZ** = High availability (failover), does NOT improve read performance
- **Read Replica** = Read performance, NO failover (except Aurora)

### 6. SNS vs SQS
- 1 producer -> 1 consumer + buffering = **SQS**
- 1 producer -> N consumers = **SNS -> N SQS** (fan-out)
- Ordering required = **SQS FIFO**

### 7. ALB vs NLB
- HTTP/HTTPS, path-based routing, L7 = **ALB**
- TCP/UDP, static IP, extreme performance = **NLB**
- If you see UDP, ALB is automatically wrong

### 8. Shield vs Shield Advanced vs WAF
- Free basic DDoS = **Shield Standard** (enabled by default)
- Advanced DDoS + cost protection + 24/7 support = **Shield Advanced**
- Application layer rules (SQL injection) = **WAF**

### 9. Secrets Manager vs Parameter Store
- Automatic credential rotation = **Secrets Manager**
- Cheap, simple config storage = **Parameter Store**

### 10. S3 Storage Class Transition Order
```
Standard -> Standard-IA (min 30 days) -> Glacier Flexible -> Glacier Deep Archive
         -> Intelligent-Tiering (if pattern is unknown)
         -> One Zone-IA (single AZ sufficient, cheaper)
```
Lifecycle rules can transition directly to a later storage class; the arrows show common cost tiers, not a mandatory sequence.

### 11. CloudFront OAC vs OAI
- **OAI** = legacy, S3 origin only
- **OAC** = new, supports S3 bucket origins, recommended over OAI

### 12. IAM Policy Evaluation Order
1. **Explicit DENY** always wins
2. **Explicit ALLOW**
3. **Implicit DENY** (default)

### 13. Route 53 Health Checks
- Failover routing REQUIRES health checks
- Health checks can be used with most routing policies

---

## 5. WRONG ANSWER ELIMINATION PATTERNS

1. **Over-Engineering trap**: If a simple managed service solves it, options with EC2 + custom scripts are wrong
2. **Protocol mismatch**: UDP = ALB is wrong, SMB = EFS is wrong, NFS = FSx Windows is wrong
3. **"Must not traverse internet"**: Any option using public internet is eliminated
4. **"Highly available"**: Any single-AZ solution is eliminated
5. **"Immediate access"**: Any option with Glacier is eliminated
6. **Cost question**: Expensive over-provisioned options are eliminated
7. **"Most secure"**: Options with public access or open security groups are eliminated
8. **Cross-account access**: Direct IAM user sharing is wrong — use IAM Roles + STS AssumeRole

## 8. HIGH-FREQUENCY CONFUSION MATRIX

The most commonly confused service pairs on the exam:

| Confusion Pair | Service A | Service B | How to Tell |
|----------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Config vs CloudTrail** | Tracks resource **configuration changes** | Tracks **API calls** (who did what) | "What changed?" = Config. "Who called it?" = CloudTrail |
| **SQS vs SNS** | **Queue** (pull-based, 1 consumer) | **Topic** (push-based, many consumers) | Buffering = SQS. Broadcasting = SNS |
| **Aurora vs RDS** | Auto-scaling storage, faster replicas, global DB | Traditional managed DB | "Auto-scale storage" or "fastest failover" = Aurora |
| **Shield vs WAF** | **DDoS** protection (L3/L4) | **Application** rules (L7: SQLi, XSS) | DDoS = Shield. SQL injection = WAF |
| **EFS vs FSx** | Linux, NFS, POSIX | Windows (SMB) or Lustre (HPC) or ONTAP (NetApp) | Linux shared files = EFS. Windows = FSx |
| **GuardDuty vs Inspector** | **Threat detection** (anomalous behavior) | **Vulnerability scanning** (EC2, containers) | "Suspicious activity" = GuardDuty. "CVE/open ports" = Inspector |
| **ALB vs NLB** | Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS), path-based | Layer 4 (TCP/UDP), static IP | HTTP/path = ALB. TCP/UDP/static IP = NLB |
| **CloudFront vs Global Accelerator** | **Caches** content at edge | **Optimizes** TCP/UDP routing (no cache) | Static content = CloudFront. Dynamic TCP/UDP = GA |
| **Secrets Manager vs Parameter Store** | Auto **rotation**, costs more | Simple config, **cheaper**, no auto rotation | "Rotate" = Secrets Manager. "Store config" = Parameter Store |
| **Kinesis vs SQS** | **Real-time streaming**, multiple shards, replay | **Queue**, message processing, decoupling | "Streaming/analytics" = Kinesis. "Decouple workers" = SQS |
| **NACL vs Security Group** | **Stateless**, subnet-level, allow + deny | **Stateful**, instance-level, allow only | Subnet rules = NACL. Instance rules = SG |
| **Gateway vs Interface Endpoint** | **Free**, S3/DynamoDB only | **Costs money**, any service | S3/DynamoDB = Gateway. Others = Interface |

---

## 9. CRITICAL GOTCHA FACTS

### S3
- Intelligent-Tiering has **no retrieval fees** (unlike Standard-IA)
- Transfer Acceleration uses CloudFront edge locations (50-500% speed improvement)
- `aws:PrincipalOrgID` condition key grants S3 access to the entire Organization
- S3 Object Lambda transforms data on-the-fly without storing copies
- S3 Event Notifications can trigger Lambda, SQS, SNS
- S3 Cross-Region Replication requires **Versioning enabled** on both buckets
- S3 Lifecycle minimum storage duration: Standard-IA = 30 days, Glacier = 90 days, Deep Archive = 180 days

### Compute
- Lambda payload limits = **6 MB synchronous / 1 MB asynchronous** (use S3 for larger payloads)
- **Spread placement group** = different hardware (HA); **Cluster** = same hardware (low latency)
- Lambda SnapStart = caches initialized state to reduce cold starts for supported runtimes such as Java
- Lambda max execution time = **15 minutes**
- Lambda concurrency limit = 1000 per region (can be increased)

### Database
- RDS automated backup retention max = **35 days** (use AWS Backup for longer)
- Aurora replicas have **minimal replication lag**
- Multi-AZ RDS = RPO < 1 second (synchronous replication)
- Aurora Global Database = cross-region, RPO < 1 second, failover < 1 minute
- DynamoDB **TTL** = automatically delete expired items (no write capacity consumed)

### Networking
- Gateway VPC endpoints are **free**; Interface VPC endpoints **cost money**
- VPC peering: works cross-account/cross-region, but CIDRs **must NOT overlap**
- NACLs are **stateless** (need inbound AND outbound rules); Security Groups are **stateful**
- Transit Gateway supports **transitive routing** (VPC peering does NOT)
- **Session Manager** = no SSH needed (preferred over bastion host)

### EBS
- **io2** supports Multi-Attach (Nitro instances, same AZ only)
- **gp3** allows independent IOPS provisioning
- EBS snapshots are **incremental**
- EBS volumes are **AZ-specific**

### CloudFront
- **Invalidation** = force refresh cached objects (costs money)
- **Lambda@Edge** = run Lambda at edge (heavier, more use cases)
- **CloudFront Functions** = lightweight viewer-level JS at edge (faster; headers, URL rewrites, redirects)

### AWS Backup
- Centralized backup across S3, EBS, RDS, DynamoDB, EFS, FSx, Storage Gateway
- Cross-region and cross-account backup copy

## 10. ROUTE 53 ROUTING POLICIES

| Policy | Use Case | Health Check | Example |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Simple** | Single resource, basic DNS | Optional | One web server |
| **Weighted** | Traffic splitting, A/B testing | Yes | 80% v1, 20% v2 |
| **Latency-based** | Route to lowest latency region | Yes | US user -> us-east-1 |
| **Failover** | Active-passive DR | Required | Primary + standby |
| **Geolocation** | Route by country/continent | Yes | EU users -> EU endpoint |
| **Geoproximity** | Route by GPS proximity, bias | Yes | Shift traffic gradually |
| **Multi-value answer** | Return multiple IPs, client picks | Yes | Load distribution without ALB |

**Key exam traps:**
- Latency-based = performance, Geolocation = compliance/legal
- Failover requires health check on primary
- Weighted can send 0% to one resource (blue-green deployment)

---

## 11. IAM POLICY EVALUATION & CROSS-ACCOUNT ACCESS

### Policy Evaluation Logic
```
1. Explicit DENY in ANY policy -> DENIED (always wins)
2. Explicit ALLOW in ANY policy -> ALLOWED
3. No explicit ALLOW -> DENIED (implicit deny)
```

### Policy Types (in evaluation order)
1. **SCP** — sets org-wide maximum permissions
2. **Resource-based policy** — attached to the resource (S3 bucket policy)
3. **Identity-based policy** — attached to IAM user/role/group
4. **Permissions boundary** — maximum permissions a role/user can have
5. **Session policy** — max permissions for assumed role session

### Cross-Account Access Pattern
```
Account A user -> AssumeRole -> Account B role -> Access Account B resources
```
- Account B creates a role with **trust policy** allowing Account A
- Account A user calls `sts:AssumeRole` for temporary credentials
- **Never share IAM users across accounts** — always use roles

## 16. SCENARIO-BASED QUESTIONS WITH EXPLANATIONS

### Scenario 1: Multi-Tier Web App

**Question**: A company needs a highly available web application with auto-scaling. The database must survive an AZ failure. What is the MOST cost-effective architecture?

**Thinking key**: "highly available" = multi-AZ everywhere. "most cost-effective" = don't over-provision.

**Answer**: ALB in public subnets -> ASG across 2 AZs in private subnets -> RDS Multi-AZ

**Why others are wrong**:
- RDS Read Replica = read scaling, NOT failover
- Single AZ ASG = not highly available
- EC2 without ASG = no auto-scaling

---

### Scenario 2: Disaster Recovery

**Question**: A company needs RPO = 1 hour, RTO = 4 hours. They want the most cost-effective DR solution.

**Thinking key**: RPO/RTO in hours = Pilot Light. "cost-effective" = not active-active.

**Answer**: Pilot Light — backup data to DR region, minimal infra running, scale up on disaster

**Why others are wrong**:
- Backup & Restore = RTO in hours-days (slowest)
- Warm Standby = RTO in minutes (more expensive than needed)
- Multi-Site Active-Active = most expensive, overkill for 4-hour RTO

---

### Scenario 3: Serverless Event Processing

**Question**: When a file is uploaded to S3, it must be processed, results stored, and the user notified. Least operational overhead.

**Thinking key**: "least operational overhead" = serverless throughout. S3 can trigger Lambda directly.

**Answer**: S3 Event -> Lambda -> DynamoDB (results) -> SNS (notification)

**Why others are wrong**:
- S3 -> SQS -> Lambda -> ... = unnecessary complexity (SQS not needed for simple trigger)
- EC2-based processing = not least operational overhead
- Kinesis = overkill for file upload events

---

### Scenario 4: Global Application

**Question**: Users worldwide need low latency for both static and dynamic content.

**Thinking key**: Static = cache it. Dynamic = optimize routing.

**Answer**: CloudFront (static content) + Global Accelerator (dynamic TCP/UDP) + Route 53 (DNS)

**Why others are wrong**:
- CloudFront alone = only caches static, dynamic still slow
- Global Accelerator alone = no caching for static content
- Multiple regional ALBs = no edge optimization

---

### Scenario 5: Database Migration

**Question**: Migrate on-premises Oracle to Aurora with minimal downtime.

**Thinking key**: Heterogeneous migration (Oracle -> Aurora) needs schema conversion + data migration.

**Answer**: AWS SCT (schema conversion) + AWS DMS (data migration with ongoing replication)

**Why others are wrong**:
- DMS alone = cannot convert Oracle schema to Aurora
- Snowball = offline, causes downtime
- DataSync = file-level, not database

---

### Scenario 6: Hybrid Connectivity

**Question**: On-premises data center needs dedicated, high-bandwidth, low-latency connection to AWS with a cheap backup.

**Thinking key**: "dedicated, high-bandwidth" = Direct Connect. "cheap backup" = VPN.

**Answer**: Direct Connect (primary) + Site-to-Site VPN (backup)

**Why others are wrong**:
- VPN alone = max 1.25 Gbps, over internet (not dedicated)
- Direct Connect alone = no backup
- VPC Peering = VPC-to-VPC only, not on-premises

---

### Scenario 7: Security Incident Response

**Question**: Detect unauthorized API calls and automatically respond.

**Thinking key**: Detect API calls = CloudTrail. Auto-respond = EventBridge + Lambda.

**Answer**: CloudTrail -> EventBridge (pattern match) -> Lambda (automated response) + SNS (alert)

**Why others are wrong**:
- GuardDuty = threat detection, not API call logging
- Config = configuration changes, not API calls
- CloudWatch Alarms = metrics-based, not event-pattern-based

---

### Scenario 8: Shared File Storage

**Question**: Multiple Linux EC2 instances need to share files concurrently. Windows instances need SMB shares with Active Directory integration.

**Thinking key**: Linux shared = NFS. Windows + AD = SMB + AD.

**Answer**: Amazon EFS (Linux) + Amazon FSx for Windows File Server (Windows)

**Why others are wrong**:
- EBS Multi-Attach = same AZ only, not designed for general file sharing
- EFS for Windows = EFS is NFS only, not SMB
- S3 = object storage, not a file system (no POSIX)

## 18. EXAM DAY STRATEGY

### Time Management
- **65 questions in 130 minutes** = ~2 minutes per question
- Flag difficult questions, move on, come back
- Aim to finish with 15 minutes for review

### Question Approach
1. **Read the LAST sentence first** — know what they are asking before reading the scenario
2. **Identify keywords** — "least overhead", "most cost-effective", "most secure", "highly available"
3. **Eliminate 2 wrong answers** immediately using the patterns in Section 5
4. **Choose between remaining 2** using keyword mappings in Section 3

### Key Decision Framework
```
"least operational overhead" -> Serverless/Managed
"most cost-effective"        -> Spot/RI/Savings Plans/right-size
"most secure"                -> Private endpoints, encryption, least privilege
"highly available"           -> Multi-AZ, multiple AZs, auto-recovery
"lowest latency"             -> CloudFront, Global Accelerator, placement groups
"decouple"                   -> SQS, SNS
"real-time"                  -> Kinesis
"batch"                      -> SQS, Batch, Glue
```

### Common Exam Traps
- **Numbers matter**: "5 TB of data" -> Snowball Edge, not DataSync
- **"Must" vs "Should"**: "Must be highly available" eliminates single-AZ
- **Two correct answers**: One is correct, one is "more correct" — pick the one that best matches the keyword
- **Distractor services**: GuardDuty is NOT for DDoS, Config is NOT for API logging

## 19. LAST 24-HOUR REVISION CHECKLIST

Know these before entering the exam:

- [ ] **S3 storage classes** and when to use each (Standard, IA, Intelligent-Tiering, Glacier, Deep Archive)
- [ ] **Object Lock**: Compliance (nobody deletes) vs Governance (override possible)
- [ ] **Gateway vs Interface VPC Endpoint**: Gateway = free (S3, DynamoDB), Interface = costs money
- [ ] **Config vs CloudTrail**: Config = config changes, CloudTrail = API calls
- [ ] **Multi-AZ vs Read Replica**: Multi-AZ = HA, Read Replica = read performance
- [ ] **ALB vs NLB**: ALB = L7 HTTP/HTTPS, NLB = L4 TCP/UDP
- [ ] **Shield vs WAF**: Shield = DDoS, WAF = SQL injection/XSS
- [ ] **Secrets Manager vs Parameter Store**: Rotation = Secrets Manager, cheap config = Parameter Store
- [ ] **SQS vs SNS**: Queue (pull, 1 consumer) vs Topic (push, many consumers)
- [ ] **Kinesis vs SQS**: Streaming/analytics vs decoupling/buffering
- [ ] **NACL vs Security Group**: Stateless/subnet vs stateful/instance
- [ ] **Route 53 policies**: Simple, Weighted, Latency, Failover, Geolocation, Geoproximity, Multi-value
- [ ] **IAM policy evaluation**: Explicit DENY wins, then ALLOW, then implicit DENY
- [ ] **Cross-account access**: Use IAM Roles + STS AssumeRole, never share users
- [ ] **Lambda limits**: 6 MB sync / 1 MB async payload, 15 min max execution, 1000 concurrency
- [ ] **RDS backup retention**: Max 35 days automated
- [ ] **EBS**: Snapshots are incremental, volumes are AZ-specific
- [ ] **CloudFront**: OAC for new setups, Invalidation costs money
- [ ] **Well-Architected 6 pillars**: Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance, Cost, Sustainability
- [ ] **DR strategies**: Backup & Restore (cheapest) -> Pilot Light -> Warm Standby -> Multi-Site Active-Active (most expensive)

---

> **EXAM STRATEGY**: When you see "least operational overhead" choose serverless. When you see "private access" choose VPC endpoint. When you see "credential rotation" choose Secrets Manager. Eliminate 2 out of 4 choices immediately, then pick from the remaining 2 using these rules.

> **GOOD LUCK!**
